#
# Purpose:
#   This script downloads and extracts the latest versions of selected Zimbra RPMs
#   to enable offline inspection of file contents and installation scripts.
#   This is especially useful when deciding whether to apply patches revealed
#   by 'dnf update' or defer them for scheduled maintenance.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Identify relevant Zimbra RPMs listed in the 'dnf update' output.
#   2. Add those package names to the PACKAGES array below.
#   3. Run this script to download, extract, and log script and build metadata.
#
# Summary:
#   - WORKDIR: The working directory used to download and extract RPMs.
#              Defaults to ~/zimbra_rpms with a subdirectory 'extracted'.
#   - RPMs:    Downloaded with all dependencies via `dnf download --resolve`
#   - Extracted Files:
#       * Extracted contents of each RPM go to WORKDIR/extracted/{rpm-name}
#       * install_scripts.txt contains post/pre install/remove scriptlets
#       * Build timestamp and metadata printed per RPM
#
# Requirements:
#   - rpm2cpio and cpio must be installed
#   - sudo privileges are needed for dnf operations
#
# Example Packages:
#   zimbra-mbox-admin-console-war
#   zimbra-mbox-webclient-war
#   zimbra-patch


PACKAGES=(
  zimbra-mbox-admin-console-war
  zimbra-mbox-webclient-war
  zimbra-patch
)
